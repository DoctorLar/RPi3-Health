# RPi3-Health
Easy script to do upgrade,update, dist, transport, and autoclean.

I had an error that my transport was missing.  This solved that.  

#### Setup ####

1. Download the install file.
  `sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoctorLar/RPi3-Health/master/health.sh`
2. Make it executable 
  `sudo chmod +x health.sh`
3. Execute it with root permissions 
  `sudo ./health.sh`


Now, whenver you want an update, just run `sudo ./health.sh` to cover all your needs.
